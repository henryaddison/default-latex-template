\section*{Cover Letter}

Dear Tilo,

The following report covers my in-progress machine learning project about emulating a climate model in order to produce rainfall projections more cheaply. A large part of my summer project was a user requirements study interviewing producers and consumers of climate projections. For brevity I have not included that in the report but have shared separately the relevant parts of my summer project write-up in case you wish to read it.

Since this is a time to reflect, I have listed below some achievements over the past 9 months and some of the problems I face ahead. I have kept this brief and informal, intended as some possible starting points for further conversation.

\subsection*{Publications}
None so far. I am due to present my work at EGU (large Geoscience conference) in May\footnote{\url{https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-6150}} and also at an RMets Student Conference in July.

I've presented my work at CDT events and a couple of times at Met Office events:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A University and Met Office Climate \& Hydrology day in April 2022
  \item A meeting of the Met Office Community of Practice in October 2021
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reflections}

Looking forward to both the near and long term future of my PhD I am aware of a few challenges and frustrations.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evaluating stochastic samples and evaluating extremes given multitude of metrics and definitions
  \item What to do next? There is plenty more to do in this project but I struggle to plan ahead 2 years and imagine a thread for the final dissertation
  \item Poor multitasking: in particular making progress on sharing my work as well as reading what others have done and gathering and analysing my data (and within that balancing data processing, model training and evaluation)
  \item Technical frustrations:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Initial dataset did not include variables at more than one height leading to re-writing a data preprocessing to use a different data source.
      \item Lack of understanding of geo data science data formats such as coordinate systems for gridded data and file metadata convention
      \item Mismatch between GCM and CPM data for same timestamp
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

I have at times spent too much time presenting my work given the limited progress I've made on the machine learning side. However, I definitely feel much more confident presenting than I did at the start of the PhD. I would like to feel the same about writing.
